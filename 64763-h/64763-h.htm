chief source of labor for the construction of the Wabash-Erie Canal. Much
strife among the canal workers stemmed from regional antagonisms in their
homeland, and personal violence resulted on more than one occasion; the
so-called &ldquo;Irish War&rdquo; was one such episode.</p>
<p>David Burr, one of the canal commissioners, made the following report
on the incident. It was printed as an Indiana state document and is often
quoted as authority for statements made about the &ldquo;Irish War.&rdquo; It is
now out-of-print. Because the Boards and staff of the Public Library of
Fort Wayne and Allen County consider it valuable source material, it is reprinted
here, together with the accompanying letter of transmittal. Grammar,
spelling, and punctuation have been changed to conform to current
practice.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>
<p>I lay before the House of Representatives the particulars, in writing,
of the late riots upon the line of the Wabash Canal, which details were furnished
at my request by one of the canal commissioners. With this history,
I also submit the claims of the commandants, Captains Murray and Tipton,
who, at the heads of their companies, repaired to the scene of disorder in
support of the civil authority and liberally advanced money and provisions
for the service. It will be seen that the laborers along the line in the adjoining
counties had assembled in preparation for battle, making Wabash
County the theater of their riotous conduct; consequently, that county would
seem to be chargeable with the expense of the arrests and the prosecutions
which followed. But as the occurrence was one of an unusual kind, growing
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
out of, and threatening the progress of, the work in which the state is
engaged, it is believed the treasury of that county is not justly chargeable
with the expense. It is recommended that the commissioners appointed to
assess damages to private property or one of the fund commissioners be
authorized to examine the different claims and to direct their payment, so
far as would be right, out of the canal fund.</p>

<p class="t0">Dear Sir:</p>
</div>
<p>In conformity with your request in relation to the disturbance amongst
the Irish laborers on the Canal, it is proper to state that many persons of
the two parties into which they are unfortunately divided, &ldquo;Corkonians and
Fardowns,&rdquo; had been engaged in those bloody affrays at Williamsport in
Maryland and at the &ldquo;high rocks on the Potomac&rdquo; within the last two years.
They had come since September in 1834 to the Wabash and Erie Canal with,
as it is said, many of their leaders. Of course, they had brought their animosities
with them. And from that time up to the twelfth of July last, when
the general riot took place, they manifested their ill will to each other by
merciless beatings on such persons of each party as chanced to fall in the
power of the other.</p>
<p>On a considerable portion of the line there was no justice of the peace
in these newly organized counties. As these frays were confined to the
Irish alone, and to the least worthy amongst them, not much effort was
made, and perhaps could not have been made, by the civil authority to suppress
them. This exasperating course of hostilities increased until it became
unsafe for the Irish to travel from one part of the line to the other
without great precautions for their safety. Events proceeded to such an
extent that they were mutually afraid that each party would have its cabins
burnt and the inmates slain in the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="600" height="876" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Because of mutual fears and for safety the laborers had so hired out
to the contractors that they had about equally divided the line between the
parties; the Corkmen worked on the upper part, and the Fardowns on the
lower part of the line. The beatings of such persons who were caught away
from their friends increased to such a degree, and the parties became so
exasperated, that about the first of July a determination became general
that one or the other should leave the line. The worthless amongst them,
by carrying threats of burnings and murders which were to be committed
by falling on the defenseless in the night, so excited their fears that they
left their houses and cabins and hid out in the woods without light or fire
to betray their hiding places. The whole line, armed in military array,
worked generally in the daytime until some idle report would get in circulation
that one party was marching to fight the other. Then they would leave
their work and hasten with great rapidity to the supposed point of danger.</p>
<p>From the fourth to the tenth of July, these alarms were constant and
were aggravated by the threats and outrages of the worthless. The length
of line occupied by these belligerent parties was nearly fifty miles. On the
tenth of July the parties hastily collected; or rather, they left their work
and commenced a march towards the center of the line for a general battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="600" height="715" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Two days before this, I reached that part of the line, heard there was
to be a turnout, but supposed it only rumor without foundation. I saw several
persons and tried to convince them that no such thing would take place.
On the tenth, however, one of the engineers reported that all the workmen
on the lower end of the line were armed and were marching to the reputed
battlefield. I met them about half a mile from my residence. They were
in very orderly array and well armed; not a noisy or a drunken man was
amongst them. They were forced, so they considered, to fight in order to
protect themselves and to avoid being slain and to keep their property from
being burned at night. They stated that the civil authority did not, or could
not, protect them; that their families could not stay in their shanties but
had to sleep in the woods; and that they had no resource left but a battle.
They further stated that the weaker party should leave the line; that they
wished to work and remain peaceable but could not; and that they would
rather fight fairly in open day than be subject to these depredations at night.
With the assurance that order would be restored and that I would negotiate
a suspension of hostilities with the other party, I prevailed on them to wait
until I could see their belligerent friends.</p>
<p>I then went to the reputed battlefield with three or four persons whom
I supposed had influence with them. I found them fully prepared, well disposed
in a strong military position, and exceedingly exasperated; and I had
some difficulty in saving those who went with me from being killed. They
expressed the same fears as the others but, after some persuasion, consented
to appoint persons to agree on terms of peace with the Fardowns.
They also agreed to suspend hostile operations until the result of the meetings
between the persons deputed to negotiate the peace could be known.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the citizens at Huntington had become exceedingly
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
alarmed at seeing this hostile array; three or four hundred armed men on
each side had the avowed intention of meeting in battle; the civil authority
was completely powerless. Fearing their persons and property would not
be safe, they sent to Fort Wayne for aid of the militia. A company immediately
was collected and in a few hours was sent to their relief. Meanwhile,
the citizens of Huntington had collected and organized a company
also.</p>
<p>By this time, the citizens of Lagro became alarmed; they sent to
Huntington for the troops to come and protect them and aid the civil authority.
As soon as I learned that the militia had turned out from sixty to one
hundred in number, I thought the force altogether too small to do any good
against seven or eight hundred armed men. Therefore, I sent to Logansport
and requested assistance, which was promptly rendered. The militia at
Lagro, at my request, marched to Miamisport and met the two volunteer
companies from Logansport; and all marched back to Lagro.</p>
<p>Two magistrates, an associate judge, the sheriffs of Huntington and
Wabash counties, and the militia arrested and committed eight of the ringleaders.
There was no safe jail on the canal line. Therefore, in order to
remove the cause of contention, these men were sent under a strong guard
to Indianapolis for safekeeping. Here they were confined until they were
liberated by a writ of habeas corpus because of some informality in the
proceedings.</p>
<p>There were more than six hundred armed Irishmen, and I am satisfied
that no course other than the one pursued would have been sufficient to
restore order. The commissioning of justices of the peace and the organizing
of militia companies at Wabash, Lagro, and Huntington have restored,
and I trust will preserve, order.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="600" height="909" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The commissioners, Messrs. Johnson and Lewis, were at Fort Wayne
at the time; and I had not the benefit of their advice. As soon as order was
restored, the canal board took more decided steps in their regulations.
They now require each contractor to dismiss any laborer who may engage
in a broil and to give his name to the engineers so that he may not be employed
on the line.</p>
<p>The militia turned out on the first moment&rsquo;s warning; many of the
men just happened to be in town and marched off without any preparation
whatever. They had of necessity to be supplied with money and provisions
for their subsistence. These were furnished by many of the contractors
and people on the line. Amongst those incurring the greatest expense was
Captain Elias Murray, of Huntington; he took command of the temporary
garrison at Lagro, assisted the civil authority in making the arrests, and,
with his company, marched the prisoners to Indianapolis. He was engaged
some three weeks in the service.</p>
<p>Colonel John Spencer, of Fort Wayne, who headed the militia from
that city, and General John Tipton, who was active in forwarding the volunteer
companies from Logansport, paid a large portion of the expenses.
One of the prisoners who had been sent to Indianapolis was arrested on his
return to the canal line, was convicted, and was sent to the penitentiary.
On his way there he escaped from Mr. Johnson, the sheriff, who offered a
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
reward of $100.00 and paid it for his apprehension. Wabash County was
also at great expense in sending the prisoners to Indianapolis. Other persons
on the line were also at much expense in money and provisions.</p>
<p>This expenditure was absolutely necessary for the preservation of
order; it was the means of saving many human lives by preventing at least
seven hundred armed and highly exasperated men from fighting a battle. It
was also the means of preventing a total suspension of canal work which
might have ensued for the greater part of the season since July. It would,
therefore, be very desirable indeed if some provision could be made by
law to remunerate those persons who have been at so great expense.</p>
<p>Some of the bills for the money expended are in the possession of the
Board of Canal Commissioners. But, as they have only a small part, the
appointment of some person to hear and examine claims and to authorize
payment is respectfully suggested. The selection of a member of the Board
of Fund Commissioners, who had no part in these transactions and would
therefore constitute an impartial tribunal, is also suggested. As the matter
in question grew out of the operations on the Canal, and as the commissioners
have the funds in their possession, such an appointment would seem
to be suitable.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
